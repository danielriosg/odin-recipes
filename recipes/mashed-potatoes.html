    <h3>Holiday Mashed Potatoes</h3>
    <p>
      These mashed potatoes are too fattening to have on a regular basis. I only
      make these on holidays, and everyone wonders what's in them that's makes
      them so rich...
    </p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds red potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil,
      and cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, add butter, and mash
      using a potato masher, ricer or mixer. Gradually beat in the heavy cream.
      Serve hot!
